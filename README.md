## Description <a id="description"></a>
Build a tap room in React where a bar or kombucha store can track their kegs. This could also be a soda fountain or another kind of tracker - as long as the remaining amount is tracked and the objectives are met, creative with this prompt is welcome.

Before getting started, plan the application and draw a component tree or component diagram that shows the structure of your components. This is a requirement for the project and should be included in the README. 

This website components planning was created with https://www.draw.io/.

Only CREATE and READ functionality are expected, although full CRUD implenetation is welcome. 

With the following user stories as a place to start, the application should have the following functionality:

- As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store).
- As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
- As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
- As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
- As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.

#### _Further Exploration_
_If there is time remaining after completing the required objectives, the following user stories are opportunities for further exploration:_

- As a user, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a keg.
- As a user, I want a keg to update to say "Out of Stock" once it's empty.
- As a user, I want kegs with less than 10 pints to include a message that says "Almost Empty" so I can try a pint before it's gone!
- As a user, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. This could be based on their price, the style of beer or kombucha, or the amount of pints left.
- As a user, I want this application to be nicely styled. (Use stylesheets and CSS objects!)
